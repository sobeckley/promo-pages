			<p class="phrase">Opari is a platform for collaborative ideating and creative problem solving which allows for asynchronous collaboration between users anywhere in the world. It is a place where creativity can thrive and where great inventions and solutions to problems of any size are born.  Opari is not a replacement for traditional methods of collaborative group work and discussion. Instead, it is a tool that individuals and teams can use to employ technology to enhance the collaborative process and continue existing discussions when face-to-face collaboration cannot take place.</p>

					<p>We believe that ideas don’t emerge as fully formed thoughts from one person on the first try, instead, breakthroughs start with a seedling of an idea, which evolves through iteration and collaboration.</p>
					<p>In keeping with this philosophy, Opari is built around the ability for users to freely share and develop these seedlings, called Sparks, into larger ideas. Sparks can be presented in the form of problems, questions, or any bit of inspiration that users choose to share. </p>
					<p>Users can share their opinions on Sparks through comments and categorize them with tags.</p>

					<p>Opari will fit a project’s needs from brainstorming to project management, allowing users to track a great Idea from conception to completion, but if our project management style is not for you, projects can be exported to other project management tools such as [insert names of other options here].</p>
